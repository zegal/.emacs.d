;;; Commentary:

;; For example, if you want to use company-elisp for auto-complete, put following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'ac-company)
;; (ac-company-define-source ac-source-company-elisp company-elisp)
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
;; (lambda ()
;; (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-company-elisp)))


;;; Code:

(require 'auto-complete)
(require 'company)

(defmacro ac-company-define-source (name backend)
  `(defvar ,name
     '((candidates . (ac-company-candidates ',backend))
       (prefix . (ac-company-prefix ',backend)))))

(defun ac-company-prefix (backend)
  (require backend nil t)
  (when (fboundp backend)
    (let ((prefix (funcall backend 'prefix)))
      (when (stringp prefix)
        (- (point) (length prefix))))))

(defun ac-company-candidates (backend)
  (funcall backend 'candidates ac-prefix))

(provide 'ac-company)
